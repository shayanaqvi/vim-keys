**Vim Keybinding Cheatsheet**
A script that displays 'basic' keybindings for Vim, written in Python. If I should add any other shortcuts you deem 'basic', please let me know.

**How to use**
1. Clone this repository
2. Unarchive the zip
3. Give the shell (.sh) script execution rights ```chmod u+x vim_keys.sh``` 
4. Execute the script ```./vim_keys.sh```

**Accessing the script from anywhere**
You could create an alias for the script:
    1. Edit your .bashrc file, usually located in your ~/ directory, in your favourite text editor (i.e. Vim :P, or nano)
    2. Create an alias with your name of choice: ```alias vim_keys="cd /path/to/extracted/folder && ./vim_keys.sh && cd"```
